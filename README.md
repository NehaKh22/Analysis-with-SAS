# Analysis-with-SAS

In my recent Human Resource Analysis project undertaken in September 2022, I harnessed the power of SAS Base to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a substantial dataset comprising 51,000 records. The project unfolded in multiple stages, beginning with a meticulous data cleansing process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset. Subsequently, I delved into an in-depth descriptive assessment, uncovering intricate patterns and characteristics inherent in the human resource data.

A pivotal aspect of the analysis involved the application of advanced data mining methodologies, prominently featuring Linear Regression. This statistical technique allowed for the exploration of relationships and dependencies within the dataset, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing various human resource-related outcomes. Beyond descriptive analysis, the project incorporated the execution of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests. These tests served as a robust means to assess collinearity among variables and guarantee homogeneity within the dataset. The ANOVA tests not only identified significant factors but also laid the groundwork for data-driven decision-making, emphasizing precision and reliability.

This project stands as a testament to my proficiency in leveraging SAS Enterprise for precise and insightful data analytics. The combination of data cleansing, descriptive analysis, and sophisticated data mining techniques, coupled with ANOVA tests, showcased a commitment to deriving actionable intelligence and facilitating effective decision-making in the complex landscape of human resource data.
